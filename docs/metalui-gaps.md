# MetalUI gaps hit by MetalCreator

MetalUI's design agent reads this file (MetalUI item C7). Each entry gives a concrete use case:
which button or gesture, which coordinates, what we do in the meantime.

## Reported 2026-10-07 (C7)

1. **Scroll wheel / trackpad scroll on an element.** Viewport: two-finger scroll zooms toward the
   cursor (needs the cursor position in the element's local points, plus phase and momentum).
   Graph panel: two-finger scroll pans and ⌘-scroll zooms. Stopgap: +/− keys and header zoom buttons.
2. **Magnify and rotate gestures.** Pinch zooms the viewport and graph about the pinch centre.
   Stopgap: none (keys only).
3. **Middle and other buttons, and right-drag.** Viewport: middle-drag pans, right-drag orbits.
   Stopgap: primary-drag orbits, Shift-drag pans.
4. **Click and tap location.** Viewport picking and the right-click face menu need the click point
   in local coordinates to read the ID buffer pixel. Stopgap: zero-distance `DragGesture` if allowed.
5. **Cursor from content, and modifiers during a drag.** Crosshair while picking, grab hand while
   panning, and ⌥ held mid-drag to duplicate nodes.
