# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project state

MetalCreator is a node-based parametric CAD app for macOS built on MetalUI (`../MetalUI`, joined in M4).
The binding spec is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-metalcreator-vertical-slice-design.md`; milestone
plans live in `docs/superpowers/plans/`. M0 (OCCT probe), M1 (graph engine), M2 (OCCT kernel) and M3 (the 26 nodes) are done. M4 (viewport) code is done; its human checks (group V in `docs/verification/human-checks.md`) are pending.

Module boundaries (dependency order):
- `CreatorGeometry`: value types (vectors, planes, profiles, bounds). Millimetres.
- `CreatorKernel`: the `Kernel` protocol, `Solid`, tagged topology tables, `FakeKernel` for tests.
- `COCCT` + `CreatorOCCT`: the OpenCascade C shim and `OCCTKernel: Kernel` (topology tables, face tags carried through
  OCCT history, tessellation, STEP/STL export). **The only code that may touch OCCT.** Every C allocation has a
  `*_free`; no C++ exception crosses into Swift.
- `CreatorGraph`: graph model, sockets, broadcasting, `Evaluator` (cached, cancellable), commands and undo,
  `.mcgraph` files, `DocumentModel`.
- `CreatorNodes`: the 26 built-in node definitions (`BuiltInNodes.registry`), UI-free: inspector sections and handles
  are data. Non-socket settings (`NodeSetting` in CreatorGraph: parameter, picks, showHandle) live in `Node.inputValues`;
  `NodeRegistry.makeNode` seeds `defaultSettings` and sets `isOutput` for `.output`-category nodes.
- `CreatorViewport`: the 3D viewport on MetalUI's `MetalView`.
  - `ViewportModel` (`@MainActor @Observable`, testable without a GPU) owns the camera, picking, the view cube,
    the context menu and handles. `ViewportRenderer`/`ViewportPicker` are the Metal side. `ViewportView` is the
    MetalUI glue.
  - It depends on Kernel, Geometry and MetalUI only, never CreatorGraph. The app shell turns graph outputs into
    `ViewportItem`s and `HandleSpec`s into `ViewportHandle`s.

Rules: keep OCCT behind `Kernel`; MetalUI gaps are logged in `docs/metalui-gaps.md` and fixed in MetalUI,
never worked around here. Graph links are kept canonically sorted by destination; result caching is keyed by node identity.
Edge/face IDs are OCCT map order. A circle edge's `direction` is its axis, so direction rules must also check `kind == .line`.
All OCCT work runs under `OCCTKernel.serialized` (process-wide lock) because OCCT shapes share geometry across solids and meshing mutates it; never call the shim outside it (tests included).
Edge picks (`EdgePick`) match by tag subsets per side and warn on count drift; selection rules never select seams. Segmented controls bind integer sockets (option index). File format is version 2 (`.edgePicks`). Create nodes only with `NodeRegistry.makeNode`. Numbers in node messages use `Locale.messages` (`Double.display`, `Int.display`).
Shim errors: `cocct::user_error` / `set_error` messages are user-facing and unprefixed; any other OCCT exception is prefixed "occt: " by `guarded` and mapped to a generic sentence by `KernelError.plainReason`.
MetalUI exports its own `Angle`: a file importing both MetalUI and CreatorGeometry writes `CreatorGeometry.Angle`.
The GPU structs in `Sources/CreatorViewport/Render` mirror the MSL in `ViewportShaders.swift`, and `GPUDataTests` pins their strides, so change both together.
Viewport input stopgaps (spec §9) live only in `ViewportInputMap`, `ViewportModifierTracker` and `ViewportKeyBindings` until MetalUI C7.

## Commands

```sh
swift build                                  # build the library
swift build -c release
swift test                                   # run all tests
swift test --filter CreatorGraphTests        # one test target (also CreatorOCCTTests, CreatorGeometryTests, CreatorKernelTests, CreatorViewportTests)
swift test --filter CreatorOCCTTests         # kernel conformance + naming stability (needs OCCT)
swift test --filter 'CreatorGraphTests.EvaluatorTests/wiredValuesFlowDownstream'   # one test
swift test --filter CreatorNodesTests        # node definitions through the real Evaluator (OCCT where geometry matters)
swift test --filter BracketAcceptanceTests   # the §7.2 bracket, headless
swift test --filter CreatorViewportTests   # viewport model, maths and the offscreen ID pass (needs a Metal device)
swift run ViewportHarness                  # dev window for docs/verification/human-checks.md group V
```

## Linting

SwiftLint is configured in `.swiftlint.yml` (each non-default setting is documented there). Run `swiftlint lint --strict` before committing; it must report zero violations. Prefer fixing the code over adding `swiftlint:disable` comments, and give any disable a reason.

## Toolchain constraints

- `swift-tools-version: 6.4`, `swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]` — full Swift 6 strict concurrency checking is on. Data-race violations are compile **errors**, not warnings. Shared mutable state needs an actor, `Sendable` conformance, or an explicit global-actor annotation; do not reach for `@unchecked Sendable` or `nonisolated(unsafe)` to silence a diagnostic without understanding it.
- Tests use **Swift Testing** (`import Testing`, `@Test`, `#expect`), not XCTest. Keep new tests on Swift Testing.
- Local toolchain: Apple Swift 6.4, arm64 macOS.
- Swift 6.4 crashes in SILGen on a key path applied to an existential metatype (`BuiltInNodes.all.map(\.typeID)`); use a closure.
- OpenCascade 7.9 comes from Homebrew (`brew install opencascade`) and is linked from `/opt/homebrew/opt/opencascade`.
  Linker warnings about dylibs built for a newer macOS are expected.
- Adding a `ConstantValue` kind, or any change older readers can't decode, requires bumping `GraphFile.currentFormatVersion`.
